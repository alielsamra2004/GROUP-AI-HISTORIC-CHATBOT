# Interactive Historian: Colorize & Chat

This project provides a Gradio web application that allows users to:
1.  Upload a grayscale historical image.
2.  Colorize the image using a pre-trained deep learning model (SIGGRAPH 17).
3.  Chat with an AI historian (powered by Google Gemini) about the context of the image.

## File Explanations

*   **`historian_chatbot.py`**: This is the core script that launches the Gradio web interface. It handles:
    *   Loading the SIGGRAPH17 colorization model.
    *   Setting up the Gradio UI using `gr.Blocks`.
    *   Processing image uploads and triggering colorization.
    *   Interacting with the Google Gemini API to provide historical context based on user queries and optional image descriptions.
*   **`colorizers/`**: This directory contains the code related to the image colorization models.
    *   `__init__.py`: Standard Python file to treat the directory as a package. Imports modules.
    *   `base_color.py`: Defines a base PyTorch `nn.Module` class from which specific colorizer models inherit.
    *   `eccv16.py`: Defines the neural network architecture and loads weights for the colorization model presented at ECCV 2016.
    *   `siggraph17.py`: Defines the architecture and loads weights for the improved colorization model presented at SIGGRAPH 2017. This is the model currently used by `historian_chatbot.py`.
    *   `util.py`: Provides helper functions for image handling: loading images (`load_img`), resizing (`resize_img`), converting between color spaces and preparing tensors for the models (`preprocess_img`), and converting model output back to a viewable image (`postprocess_tens`).
*   **`imgs/`**: Contains example grayscale images that can be used with the application.
*   **`demo_release.py`**: A standalone Python script (likely the original demo for the colorization code) that runs colorization on a single image specified via command-line arguments and saves/displays the output using Matplotlib. It is not directly used by the Gradio app.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Specifies the Python libraries needed to run the project.
*   **`README.md`**: Provides information about the project, its structure, and how to run it.
*   **`LICENSE`**: Contains the license information for the project code.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd GROUP-AI # Or your project directory name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:** (Recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv  # Or python3 -m venv .venv
    # Activate the environment:
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install Gradio, Google Generative AI, PyTorch, scikit-image, and other necessary libraries. The colorizer models might download pre-trained weights on first run.

4.  **Set Up Google Gemini API Key:**
    *   You need an API key from Google AI Studio (formerly MakerSuite).
    *   Open the `historian_chatbot.py` script.
    *   Find the line `API_KEY = "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"` (or similar).
    *   Replace `"YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"` with your actual Gemini API key.
    *   **Security Note:** For better security, consider setting the API key as an environment variable (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`) and loading it in the script using `os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")` instead of hardcoding it.

5.  **Run the Gradio App:**
    ```bash
    python historian_chatbot.py
    ```

6.  **Access the App:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860` or similar).
    *   Upload a grayscale image, click "Colorize Image".
    *   Optionally add text context about the image.
    *   Ask the historian chatbot questions in the chat interface.
